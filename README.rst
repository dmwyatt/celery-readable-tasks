What this is
============
Logs generated by ``celery`` have each task marked with its unique ID.  It's useful to compare ids
as you can have the same task running in more than one process.

By default ``celery`` generates unique ids with the python ``uuid`` package.  UUID's are fine, but it's very hard
to visually compare different ids.

``celery-readable-tasks`` provides a way to have readable task ids to alleviate this issue.

Usage
=====
For your typical task functions decorated with ``app.task`` or ``shared_task`` decorators, you can do this::


    from celery-readable-tasks import ReadableTask

    @shared_task(base=ReadableTask)
    def my_task():
       pass


If you're going to use classes for your tasks, just subclass ``ReadableTask``.
